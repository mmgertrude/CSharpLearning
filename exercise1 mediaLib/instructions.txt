Practice Creating Classes in C#

To run the code in the terminal:
Navigate to the right folder:
  Marys-MacBook-Air:CSharpLearning gertrude$ cd exercise1\ mediaLib/
Use the mcs command to compile the program
  Marys-MacBook-Air:exercise1 mediaLib gertrude$ mcs *.cs -out:Program.exe
followed by:
Marys-MacBook-Air:exercise1 mediaLib gertrude$ mono Program.exe

OR all together:
Marys-MacBook-Air:exercise1 solution gertrude$ mcs *.cs -out:Program.exe && mono Program.exe

1st Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. Add at least two classes to your program—one class for each type of item—or media type—that can be added to your media library.
  a) Define each class using the `class` keyword within its own C# code file. 
  b) Use "Treehouse.MediaLibrary" for the namespace.

2. Add at least two public fields to each media type class that you added in step #1.
  a) Each field definition should include an access modifier, a data type, and a name.

Media Type Examples

* Album media type, with `Title` and `Artist` fields
* Book media type, with `Title` and `Author` fields
* Movie media type, with `Title` and `Director` fields

2nd Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. In the Program.cs file `Main()` method, use the `new` keyword to create at least one instance of each of your media type classes.

2. For each of the objects that you create, set each field to an appropriate value.

3rd Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. Add a constructor to each of your media type classes.

2. Define a constructor parameter for each of the media type's required fields and use those parameter values to initialize its fields.

3. Update the Program.cs file `Main()` method in order for your program to successfully compile.

4.a) The objects´field values can be changed after they have been instanciated,
change the album title to "Let it Be" (in Program.cs)
b) To prevent such changes to field values make the necessary update to the class field definitions
