Practice Methods in C#

1st Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. Add a `GetDisplayText()` method to your selected media type class. This method should return a string containing the display text for the media type item.

Example: The `GetDisplayText()` method for an Album class would return the text "Album: Yellow Submarine by The Beatles" if the `Title` field was set to "Yellow Submarine" and the `Artist` field was set to "The Beatles".

2nd Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. Add a method named `Loan()` that accepts a string of the name of the person who is borrowing the item.
  a) Store the person's name in a new field named `Loanee`.
  b) Use a boolean field, `OnLoan`, to indicate whether or not an item has been loaned out.

2. Add a method named `Return()` that resets the loan related fields to their default values.
  a) `null` for the `Loanee` field and `false` for the `OnLoan` field.

3. Update the `GetDisplayText()` method to include the loan related fields if the item is on loan.
  a) For example, if an album is currently on loan, it should display the text "Album: Yellow Submarine by The Beatles (Currently on loan to Joe Smith)".

4. Test your changes by updating the Program.cs file `Main()` method to call the `Loan()` and `Return()` methods.

3rd Challenge
--------------------------------------------------

1. Add a method overload for the `Loan()` method that doesn't accept any parameters.

2. Update the `GetDisplayText()` method to account for when the `Loanee` field doesn't have a value.
